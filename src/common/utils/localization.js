    faq_a1: <p>You can buy new theorems which become yours to name. You will receive a printable certificate in PDF form
      of the theorem and its discovery (including an outline of the proof). You can then give this away, frame it, sing
      it, as you like! Also, you can purchase a range of products to go with your theorem, like T-shirts, mouse mats and
      mugs. All gift items are provided and manufactured by Zazzle.</p>,
    faq_a2: <p>If you are not already registered with TheoryMine, you will receive a user name and password to log into
      the website where you will be able to view the status of your order. It will take a up to 5 working days
      (excluding weekends) for our robot mathematicians to discover your theorem. You will receive a notification email
      once your theorem is discovered. You will then be able to download the certificate by logging into this website,
      and clicking &quot;View Certificate&quot;</p>,
    faq_a3: <p>Yes. You will be able to purchase additional gift packages (t-shirts, mugs and mouse mats) with your
      theorem once you have received your certificate. You can do so by logging in to your account and click on the

    faq_a9: <p>Some PDF readers might not support the mathematical characters that appear in the certificate. You might
      not see these characters when you open the certificate or when you print it. However, if you use Adobe Reader
      (available for free <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/">here</a>) you will not have any of these problems.'
    </p>,
    faq_a10: <p>From school mathematics you will recall various kinds of numbers: whole numbers, fractions, decimals,
      etc. You may also have met sets or vectors. These are all examples of mathematical
        objects. The first thing that TheoryMine does is create new kinds of mathematical object and it can generate
      an unlimited number of these. In school mathematics you apply functions
      to numbers, such as addition and subtraction. The second thing that TheoryMine does is create new kinds of
      functions on these new mathematical objects. TheoryMine can also generate an unlimited number of functions. A
      Theory is composed of one or more mathematical objects plus some functions on such mathematical objects.</p>,
    faq_a11: <p>A theorem is a mathematical formula for which we have a
      proof. Both theorems and proofs are within a theory which consists of a set of axioms. A proof is a sequence of
      formulae, starting with some axioms and ending with the theorem. Each non-axiom formula in this sequence follows
      from the previous formulae in the sequence. All the axioms in TheoryMine theories are recursive definitions.</p>,
    faq_a12: <p>>Recursion is a mathematical technique that is much
      used in computer programs. In a recursive definition, the value of a recursive function is defined in terms of
      values of the same function applied to smaller inputs. This sounds circular, but because the function's inputs
      get smaller and smaller the computation eventually stops.TheoryMine also uses recursion to define brand new types
      of input and output for each theory.These are called recursive objects. </p>,
    faq_a13: <p>TheoryMine proves properties of functions. For instance, when it comes to addition, it does not matter
      in which order the numbers are added: 2+3 is equal to 3+2, whereas when it comes to subtraction it does: 2-3 is
      not equal to 3-2. TheoryMine might discover that some of its functions are like addition; giving equal answers
      whatever the order of the objects to which they are applied. Some functions are inverses of each other, e.g.
      addition and subtraction: adding a number and then subtracting it, brings you back to where you started.
      TheoryMine might also discover that some of its new functions are also inverses. The theorems discovered by
      TheoryMine typically take this simple form.</p>,
    faq_a14: <p>The computer programs behind TheoryMine are large and complex and so, like all large complex programs,
      almost certainly contain bugs However, most of the program merely chooses theories and theorems to prove, and
      directs their proof. The construction of the proof is handled by a small, well inspected and highly trusted kernel
      program that only combines axioms and previously proved theorems. It is therefore vanishingly unlikely that any
      proof it constructs would be faulty.</p>,
    faq_a15: <p>TheoryMine is based on decades of world-class research into automated reasoning and artificial
      intelligence at the Universities of Edinburgh, Cambridge and Munich. It uses the grammars of theories and theorems
      to generate candidates, filters out the obviously false and uninteresting ones, and then uses automated reasoning
      to see which of the remainder it can prove.</p>,
    faq_a16: <p>The TheoryMine program constructs brand new mathematical theories, that no-one has previously developed
      by using brand new recursive functions and recursive objects. By definition, all theorems of these new theories
      are themselves brand new.</p>,
    faq_a17: <p>There are two senses in which your theorem is not trivially true. Firstly, note that some mathematical
      theories are inconsistent i.e. the axioms contradict each other. In such theories all formulae are theorems, which
      is clearly undesirable. However, it is a well-established mathematical result that theories consisting only of
      recursive definitions, as TheoryMine's theories are, are inherently consistent. So you can be sure that your
      theorem is not trivial in this sense. The second sense in which these theorems are not trivially true is that they
      cannot be directly derived by a simple calculation. In particular, they are not true by simple rewriting from
      other known theorems, as described in more detail in the answer to the question: <a href="#interesting">IS MY
        THEOREM INTERESTING?</a>.</p>,
    faq_a18: <p>TheoryMine applies a series of filters to remove uninteresting theorems before it generates them. On the
      other hand, don't expect your theorem to earn you the Fields Medal! (the Nobel Prize of Mathematics). In
      particular, we use the notion of interesting initially developed in <a
        href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/bk711q2u247mr967">Conjecture Synthesis for Inductive Theories (Journal
        of Automated Reasoning)</a> which was then further developed in <a
        href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/m885557421m7418m">Scheme-Based Synthesis of Inductive Theories (LNCS,
        Volume 6437)</a>.Technically, this ensures that standard orderings, using known theorems as rewrites, cannot
      prove the new theorem : that there is no direct symbolic calculational proof of the new theorem. </p>,
    faq_a19: <p>It is a long-standing tradition in mathematics that the author of a new theorem has the authority to
      name it. TheoryMine assigns that authority to you.</p>,
    faq_a20: <p>A theorem, once proved, stays proved for ever. The reasoning in the proof is deductive, so contains no
      element of probability or uncertainty. Theorems are abstract objects that are not subject to wear and tear. Even
      diamonds will be destroyed in the heat death of the universe; theorems won't be.</p>,

    gift_title: <p>Gift Packs:</p>,
    gift_p1: <p>When you name a theorem you attach your name to something that will survive throughout history.</p>,
    gift_p2: <p>The creation of a working mathematical theorem or law usually requires extensive work by a rare and
      brilliant mind. This gives the creator the right to have the theorem take their name; names like Gauss, Fermat and
      Pythagoras. Now anyone who wants to have their name immortalised along with the giants of maths and science can do
      so. This is possible thanks to a system that generates and proves completely new theories and theorems.The
      theorems that we produce are guaranteed to be unique, because we generate them from unique theories. Inductive
      theories are guaranteed to be consistent, by design, so the generated theorems are not spuriously true.</p>,
    gift_p3: <p>You can name a new theorem however you like and you will be able to decide if you would like to have a
      certificate detailing your theorem delivered to you, have it published in our journal, and even have it printed on
